                        Oliver uses nature as a springboard-the beating heart of her work.

                            <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's
                                novel"<u>The Anthologist,"</u> scrawls in the margins of Oliver's"<u>New and Selected
                                    Poem, Volume One."</u> A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of
                                writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him,
                                ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry
                                anthology that he has putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets
                                who have been his touchstones-Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale-before
                                discovering Oliver. In her work, he find consolation: "immediately felt more sure of
                                what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has
                                something."

                                 I don't know exactly what a prayer is
                                 I do now how to pay attension, how to fall down
                                 into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
                                 how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
                                 which is what I have been doing all day
